Why It's Important to Have Goals 
---------------------------------

_Goal setting_ is something that you hear a lot about in school. Your teachers might have had you set goals for the upcoming school year. Or, you may have been asked to set a goal for the current sports season.

A lot of times, setting goals can seem like just another typical assignment. But, it’s really not. 

Goals are the one thing that often sets high achievers apart from other people. You can bet your favorite sports star sets goals. Actors, musicians and influencers also set goals that help them achieve success in their careers.

Understanding _why goals are important_ helps you to make more effective ones that push you closer to achieving your dreams.

Make It Easier to Stay Focused
------------------------------

Strong goals are like a road map that show you exactly where to go next. 

Mountain climbers rarely set out without a defined trail to travel. Most mountain trails also have markers along the way that let you know when they split or hit a landmark. 

This helps you to avoid meandering off in the wrong direction. Goals work the same way. 

Once you know what you want to achieve, you’ll be less likely to get distracted. 

_Defining your goal_ also helps your brain to see it as being important. If your goal is to get on the basketball team, then you’ll _see the point_ in making it to every practice session.

Get Motivated for Success
-------------------------

Have you ever been ready to clean your room, but had no idea where to begin? Feeling scattered and overwhelmed makes it harder to get started on a task. 

_Smart goals are specific_, which means that you’ll know exactly what you need to work on.

With a clear goal in mind, you’ll be able to start _taking action_ immediately. Whether that means putting your phone away and studying or heading to the practice court, you won’t waste time trying to figure out what to do first.

The best part is that you’ll also feel excited about working on making progress!

Starting on a new goal is a lot like setting out on a new adventure. Knowing that you’ll end the journey a better person helps you to keep up your motivation for doing your best!

Stay On Track By Measuring Your Progress
----------------------------------------

A good goal should also be _measurable_. Hitting those little markers along the way gives you an instant motivational boost that helps you keep going. You can even set smaller goals that lead up to a bigger one. 

Depending upon your goals, you can use a calendar, chart or other tracking tool. 

When you reach a milestone moment, do a little celebrating! If you were climbing a mountain, you could take a moment to enjoy a pretty view or pull out your trail mix. 

Give yourself a pat on the back or enjoy a small treat. Recognizing your achievements activates the reward center in your brain, much like you get when you play a video game. 

Only this time, you’re making real life progress that pays off over time.

Creating goals doesn’t just have to revolve around school. You can choose to set a goal to work on a hobby rather than spend time scrolling online. Or, you may want to do random acts of kindness. 

The important thing is to make sure your goals fit your values. Then, choose how you want to define them and start tracking your progress. You can be on your way to completing your next goal today.
