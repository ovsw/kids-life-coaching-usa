**Journalin**g is currently trending, and you’ll find that writing about the story of your life is far more fun than you might think. Today, journaling is so much more than taking notes in class. Instead, you can use a journal as **a form of self-expression** that makes it exciting to write about your experiences.

First, you’ll want to pick out your preferred journal, and consider using colorful markers or pens to inspire your creativity. Then, you can start using these ideas to begin filling your pages with tons of stories.

Start a Page With Your Current Emoji
------------------------------------

The hardest part about journaling is **getting started**. Putting an emoji at the top of the page helps you get something on the paper. You’ll also love having a quick way to check in with how you’re feeling. You can then use this cute image to help you decide what to write next.

Remember an Awesome Day
-----------------------

One of the coolest things about journals is being able to look back and **remember the good times** in your life. If today was really awesome, then jot down a few things about why it was so great. One day, **you might want to look back and remember** that time you earned an award or made a new friend.

Write Through a Challenge
-------------------------

You can also use your journal for **problem-solving**. It’s fun to see how sometimes a solution to a problem will just appear as you write. You might start writing about an argument you had with a friend and then suddenly see their perspective. You can use this **new insight** to mend your friendship.

Sometimes, you might not be looking for a solution to a challenge. **Venting** is another thing that journals are good for. In your journal, you can rant about a situation all you want without having to worry about hurting someone’s feelings. 

Use a Writing Prompt
--------------------

On days that you don’t know what to write about, you can use a prompt. Writing prompts are a fun way to challenge your creativity. You might also find that a prompt leads you down an unexpected path. You could find yourself writing a short story or discovering a new idea for a craft or hobby. We need to explain what a prompt is.

Try Doodle Journaling
---------------------

Have you ever had trouble coming up with the words to describe a situation? That’s a common problem all writers face at some point. You can fix this problem by **drawing pictures instead of writing**. You’ll still get the same benefit of getting thoughts out of your head onto paper. You can also doodle alongside words to add some extra fun to your writing. 

End With An Emoji Showing Your New Mood
---------------------------------------

**Creating little rituals** helps you to stay on track with your journaling. At the end of each page, put an emoji that shows how you feel now. Seeing how your crying emoji turned to one that is laughing by the end shows you just how much your mood can change when you write about your day.

**Once you get into journaling, it’s hard to stop.** If you do find yourself getting bored, then try changing things up. Using a new pen or journaling outside at the park are just a few more ways to add some excitement to your daily writing times.
