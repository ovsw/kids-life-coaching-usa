What Gets You Motivated? 
-------------------------

**Motivation** is one of those words that you hear thrown around a lot. Teachers often have motivational posters on the walls with cute pictures and sayings. 

One example is going to pep rallies to help your school’s sports teams get motivated before a game.

People often think of motivation as a feeling of excitement. You can feel excited when you are motivated, but this word also expresses a point of action. 

> **Motivation is a drive or need to work towards achieving a goal.** 

This could be as simple as deciding to get up and eat breakfast. Or, you may feel a sudden burst of motivation to start working on a homework assignment the night before it is due. 

The trick to making motivation work for you is to figure out what inspires you to want to take action.

**Do you know what gets you motivated?** Exploring these common motivators can help you recognize what gets you ready to work on meeting your goals.

### Hunger and Thirst

At the most basic level, you can’t do much if you are hungry or thirsty.  
  
Hunger is a powerful motivator that can drive you to get out of bed even when you’re sick.  
  
People are also motivated to go to work each day to make sure they can put food on the table.

### Money and Rewards

Depending on your age, you may be motivated to find a job so that you can start earning money for your first car. If you’re younger, you may be motivated to do your chores to earn an allowance. 

People also tend to get motivated by the chance to earn other awards. Whether you look forward to getting a virtual award when you win a video game or like getting shiny sports trophies, winning feels so good that you’ll work hard to earn your reward.

### Recognition and Approval

You know that amazing feeling you get when a teacher or coach gives you a compliment? Well, that is a strong motivator to keep working hard to earn other people’s approval.

While success truly should come from inside yourself, it is also okay to look forward to recognition for a job well done. For example, you might look forward to the applause you’ll receive after finishing a choir concert or school play.

### Fulfilling a Passion

Right now, you are at the perfect stage in life to explore your passions and discover new ones. Hobbies are powerful motivators, and you might find that your desire to learn a new trick drives you to get dressed and head to the skate park.

Someone with a passion for animals might get motivated to volunteer at an animal shelter. You could also decide to set goals to help you become a veterinarian as you work your way through school.

### Being Part of a Group

Developing social relationships is another thing that may motivate you to do your best. Your drive to avoid letting your sports team down could motivate you to practice. Or, you might work hard in school to get into a specific college. 

You could even use the desire to avoid getting grounded before an upcoming social event as a motivator to follow the rules at home.

Now that you know all about some of the most powerful motivators, take a moment to think about what works best for you. Keep in mind that a motivator can change depending upon your goal. Getting to know what inspires you to take action gives you an edge on making good things happen in your life.
